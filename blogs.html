                    For years now I've wanted to make a website for myself from scratch. No frameworks, no website building tools like Wordpress or Squarespace, just a plain old text file.
                    Why exactly did I want to do this when there are countless tools online that would've made my work easier and perhaps even better? Well, uh, I'll tell you in a second.

                <p> There was something about websites back in the day that had a certain charm to them. There was no in-between, they were either a crazy Times-Square esque billboard
                    extravaganza with graphics and animations all over the place or extremely simple and to the point 
                    (like <a href="https://billwurtz.com" target="_blank"  id="linkToBill">Bill Wurtz's</a> website). 
                    Now, I would be lying if I said this is what I wanted to emulate when I set off to build this site but the truth is, this is what I liked.  
                    Eventually, it did end up looking like one of those old-school websites with moving parts and graphics, it was by no means on purpose, but I love it anyway.

                    In my journey of three days that it took for me to get here, I went through several stages of decision making. Initially, my plan was to use this recently released
                    relatively unknown tool- um, chat-gps or something, to code this whole thing for me. Quickly, I realized that this would be a fruitless attempt.

                <p> There were many problems. It would constantly forget that we were working on a project and try to do things from scratch halfway through the process. 
                    Not really sure how I can phrase it but let's just say it wasn't iterative. 
                    Meaning, after we fixed a problem, say, a flex box being corrected to its right position, it would forget that we did this as I continued on with the following tasks.
                    I would constantly have to paste the updated code to remind it - 'Hey! Look! We're here now, stop using code from 4 prompts ago!'. 
                    Not to mention the downtimes, I think the recent announcement of GPT-4 created much frenzy 
                    and bogged
                    down the servers. So, I didn't get very far going this route and it only ended up setting up a container for me to work on and helped write the JavaScript for my continously increasing
                    age. Alas, I decided to use this tool as it was meant to be used, a question-answer machine and it was quite brilliant at that.

                <p> I decided to get on with it and learn the damn language myself. What I found was that HTML itself was really easy and straightforward, CSS on the other hand
                    refused to cooperate. Simple instructions with layouts and formats would only be possible with the most roundabout solutions. My friend in this land was the inspector tool
                    on Chrome (eventually I switched to good ol' Firefox and it has the best inspector tool omg) through which I learned the layout of a box: the margin, border, padding and content.
                    This was a crucial step in understanding why things would behave the way they did when I decided to change something on my site.</p>

                <p> Relatively soon, I found myself at a fork: flexbox or grid? I learned shortly after that this was a matter of great debate amongst the Web Devs of the
                    world. I decided to go with flexbox because the name fooled me into thinking that it would be flexible to my needs and my wants. I now regret this decision after
                    many hours of trying to resize the box in my header so my picture could be the same size as my title (I still haven't figured it out). And also because some CSS YouTuber mentioned that grid is 
                    like the way to go man.

                    So, to answer the question, I really just wanted to challenge myself to learn the fundamentals of the language and more importantly, I wanted this website to have a personality
                    that reflected mine instead of a generic looking site that you could easily make with a free HTML template found online. The ticker board animation listing my skills
                    and the 1D flip cards were all just me experimenting with different CSS techniques I found on W3 or CodePen. Before this, I had made two attempts to learn HTML amd 
                    failed, and I realize now the reason was because I tried to learn through videos and courses rather than just taking on a project and learning along the way. I will
                    continue to learn this way and hopefully add more content to this site, though I expect it will remain mostly the same.
